## Pressure evolution in two hydraulically connected reservoirs

This Jupyter Notebook and accompanying text files are used to run the two-reservoir analytical model and produce Figure 4b and c from "Two distinct magma storage regions at Ambrym volcano detected by satellite geodesy," <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> by T. Shreve, Y. Zhan, H. Le Mével, D. Roman, & Y. Moussallam (2023). It can also be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.org). 

This analytical model follows the formulation of T. Wang, Y. Zheng, F. Pulvirenti, & P. Segall (2021). "Post-2018 caldera collapse re-inflation uniquely constrains Kīlauea's magmatic system," *Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth*, 126, e2021JB021803. https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JB021803.
